# 🎨 Deep Learning GANs

This repository contains implementations of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** from scratch using Tensorflow / keras.  
It includes two classic experiments:

- **Vanilla GAN on MNIST** (handwritten digits)
- **DCGAN on Fashion-MNIST** (fashion items)

Both implementations include Jupyter notebooks and equivalent Python scripts, with outputs saved during training.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Vanilla GAN trained on MNIST dataset.
- DCGAN trained on Fashion-MNIST dataset.
- Both notebook (`.ipynb`) and script (`.py`) versions.
- Organized `dcgan_output/` and `vanilla_output/` folders for generated samples and checkpoints.
- `assets/` folder showcasing the best generated results.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/faisal-ajao/deep-learning-gans.git
cd deep-learning-gans

# (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\\Scripts\\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the notebooks interactively:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Or execute the Python scripts directly:

```bash
# Vanilla GAN on MNIST
python vanilla_gan_mnist.py

# DCGAN on Fashion-MNIST
python dcgan_fashion_mnist.py
```

Generated images and model checkpoints will be saved inside the respective output folders.
